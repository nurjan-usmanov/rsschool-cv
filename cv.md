## About myself

My profession is a teacher of mathematics and physics. But a few years ago, my simple interest in IT turned into the goal of becoming an IT professional today. While learning programming, I realized that this is my field.

I like to learn new things. Sometimes a difficult problem comes up while coding, and I get a great feeling when I find a solution to that problem.

Currently, using the knowledge I have gathered, I am creating the Front-end part of simple, small sites for myself and placing them on the AQNIET.UZ domain.

## Skills

* __HTML__ and __CSS__ from markup languages
* __JavaScript__ and its libraries (like __React__ and others)
* I have a basic understanding of __Node.js__ and __Express__ and I think I can work with them.
* I have used __Sublime Text__, __Brackets__ and __VS CODE__ from text editors, but mostly I like to work with __VS CODE__.
* I can also use __git__ and __github__

## Work experience

Until today, I have not participated in any money projects. However, for the past 6-7 months, coding has become a daily exercise for me.
